<q>Have you ever have problem someone trying to access your site</q>

<span>via your public ip? or maybe your forward dynamic dns?</span>

<h1 align=center>RandomProtect</h1>
<p align=center>Simple and (yet) funny way to protect site scraping.</p>

<hr>

Build from ground up , (meme) and simple HTML and some JavaScript to spice thing up. This (not) groundbreaking technology that we called

```javascript
window.location.href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ;
```
<center>
<q><b>Redirect people straight to Rickroll!</b></q>
<p>used for protect other to access anything else except what supposed to!</p>
</center>

> [!NOTE]
> **Still recommended to use Cloudflare Proxy at all cost and only Open the Port that needed!** Since this doesn't help with DDoS Attack, Port Scanning, DNS Dumpster and anything , **only to protect someone typing the address on the browser or (some) bot scraping your IP to do some nasty piece of s-**

But instead only rickroll, we put another meme (or maybe anime song) link on Youtube and random it everyone they tried to visit!
